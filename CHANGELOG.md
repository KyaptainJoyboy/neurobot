## Afterthoughts
- This project was a blast to work on, it may seem quite primitive, but at heart it's a learning experience I'll remember for a very long part of my life. From initial setup to the final product, I've learned so much about the world of programming and how to approach it, even if it was slighty assisted by AI along the way. This won't be it's final version however, I plan on fleshing it out further, using modern frameworks such as tailwind, maybe. For now, that's all from me, chesugotgit.

## 2024 - 12 - 13
## FINAL RELEASE (probably)
- Added dropdowns to a couple of empty feature boxes
- Fixed font styling on all of the buttons (hopefully)
- Made Timers generalized instead of specific use

- This will most likely be the final update from active development, and the next update will most probably take a really long time as we continue to move to other projects, still, this was a fun learning journey for everyone involved.
